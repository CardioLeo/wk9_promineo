can use modules of bootstrap. can't assume userbase has best devices to download complex stuff.

think of what your specific users are likely to use; and take that into account so you don't make a website too heavy, too long to download.

bootstrap

node.js

... etc.

bootstrap uses more packages and libraries? (or was it JSON that uses more?)

Website- NPMjs website, bootstrap etc.

the less files you have to download as it goes on, the better.

---

make sure you upload .gitignore to your bootstrap/json webpage git repos. make sure it ignores the first npm folder installed - the packages.

***nodeModules folder***

you don't want to upload other people's packages to your github repo, because you didn't make those.

so the package-json file, the nodemodules folder, these ought to be ignored by gitignore

Jquery interacts with DOM and javascript; less popular than it was; we will get into this in the coming weeks. not a bad idea to cover it, not too hard; takes some time; ***bootstrap 5 doesn't use jquery anymore.***

learn tailwind instead when you have more time later - more popular in more recent years; not necessarily a rush, but will be good to have.

CDN. hm, Content Delibery Network.

npm init -y // -y makes you bypass the questions it asks you
npm install boostrap[] --save
npm install --save // I think I copied this line okay.

Bootstrap --> HTML5;
HTML5 --> Bootstrap;

Bootstrap Grid
-responsive design
--rows, columns
-classes
--container
--**--"container"
--**--"container-fluid"
--rows
--columns
--**--col-sm, col-md, col-lg, col-xl
--**--based on 12 columns (100%)
--**---**--by default, equally distributed, can optionally specify "size". i.e., col-sm-3, etc.
--**---**--size refers to screen size.

[before CSS classic html tables were used for layout, tables are based on rows and columns]

design still uses grids ^^^ columns; usually 12, but not always. interesting.

Colors/ context, can be applied to most components...... didn't get to finish copying.

[bootstrap - lots of files - are you sure you want to use bootstrap?]

.css
.css.map
.min.css

here, ".min.css" does not compile, but does "minify" makes smaller, makes variables smaller, gets rid of spaces; smallest file size needed for this project. interesting.

getbootstrap.com/

^^ looks like a good website

modal website, moodle(?)

base class and secondary class

<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary">Secondary</button>

'' '' '' danger, warning, light, dark, grey, etc.

flex box behaviors;
<div class="d-flex p-2"

flex box behavior in CSS;

Stepanski recommends learning how to do that CSS without bootstrap;

bootstrap does things for you that you should be able to do without bootstrap.

use bootstrap?

if you're going to use bootstrap, go to the documentation over and over again; just don't be too dependent on it.

colors in bootstrap, huh, $yellow-800 $green-700 $teal-400

next week, away from HTML and CSS;
7, 8, 9 --- the none programming part of the program.

week 10+ will be a return to javascript. will show how to dynamically change items on a page.

pretty much all static - html, css, and even bootstrap.

javascript can relatively easily change the content of html, etc.

ha, haha, we have to attend some events for career services this week. Oh, that sucks. week 9. Not sure that'll work.

"Attend a meetup." Craaaaaaaaap. (it's so hard to escape from what I have to do, sooo much to do)

Frank asked if any of us were behind on projects, if any of us needed to catch up to at least week 7. He said I can message him about the Week 6 program, because I told him in class I hadn't finished it.

how am I going to find a good meetup to attend.

meetups I could attend:
-Colorado linux?
-Colorado C++ (Michael's? but it occurs on Thursdays, and that probably won't happen)
-Colorado... web development and graphic design? it will be too intimidating if it is just GD, so I should look primiarily for wd.
